# Auto Transfer (name suggestions welcome!)

A small experimentation related to the
[shinseibank-ruby](https://github.com/knshiro/shinseibank-ruby) gem.

This Ruby on Rails application offers a recurring task that, when run, will
check all scheduled transfers, and send me an email that allows me to execute
the transfer in one click.
